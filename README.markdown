#CKHTMLIndexer

CKHTMLIndexer indexes a set of HTML files, associating words to file paths.  I still need to write code to actually _use_ the generated index.

##Usage

html\_indexer _directorypath_ _indexpath_ [blacklistpath]

This will index the given directory and generate a Core Data SQLite file at the index path.  It will also generate HTMLIndexer.mom, a Core Data model file, next to the index file.  This needs to be used in the application that loads the index file. Any words contained in the blacklist file are ignored.

__Note:__ This project uses [data2source](http://github.com/cmkilger/data2source) to generate the mom file.  It currently assumes that data2source is installed at ~/.bin (that's where I put it).  If you don't have it, the script which updates the source files will fail.  If you don't change the data model, this shouldn't be a problem for you, just remove the "Data Model Source Files" target, or the dependency, or comment out the line that says "~/.bin/data2source â€¦", or something like that.
